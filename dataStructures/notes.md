Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operatoins that can be applied to the data

all have their own unique uses:

- working with map/location GPS data? - use a graph
- need an ordered list with fast insertions/removals at the beginning and the end? - use a linked list
- webscraping nested HTML? - use a tree
- need to write a scheduler? - use a binary heap
