Singly Linked lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when 
insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required

Arrays contain a built in index, while linked lists do not

The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the 
foundation for other data structures like stacks and queues

Big O notation:

Insertion - O(1)

Removal - 
    if we are removing from the very beginning - O(1)
    if we are removing anywhere else, we will have to iterate
        through the list until we find the node we need to remove
        - O(N)

Searching - O(N)

Access - O(N)
